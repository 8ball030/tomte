# tomte
A library that wraps many useful tools (linters, analysers, etc) to keep Python code clean, secure, well-documented and optimised.

Essentially does nothing else but pinning multiple packages to compatible versions, for consistency across many projects.

Extremely (!) opinionated by design!

## Name
